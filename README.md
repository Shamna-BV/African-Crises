# African-Crises
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict economic and financial crises in African countries.  By analyzing historical data encompassing various economic indicators and crisis events, the project aims to develop predictive models that can assist policymakers and financial institutions in proactive decision-making to mitigate potential crises.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of the "African Crises" project are:

* Data Exploration and Visualization: Understand the distribution and relationships of economic indicators and their association with crisis events.
* Feature Engineering: Develop meaningful features that enhance the predictive power of the models.
* Model Development: Build and evaluate various machine learning models to predict economic and financial crises.
* Model Interpretation: Analyze model outputs to identify key predictors and understand their impact on crisis prediction.
